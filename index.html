                In this role I led the design, delivery and integration of the E-shift system for the Bentayga and
                3rd-generation Continental vehicle platforms.
                This required cross-functional collaboration with both Bentley‚Äôs mechanical engineering team and
                external suppliers to develop a system specific to Bentley, meet product and performance specifications
                whilst utilising existing technology to reduce investment costs.
                My responsibilities included creating project documentation such as technical specifications, validation
                plans and test reports with recommendations to the business.
                In addition, I provided technical information to suppliers and commercial colleagues, such as 3D models,
                technical drawings and both electrical and mechanical analysis and recommendations to provide accurate
                feedback and solutions to suppliers, Bentley Styling and Bentley Trim departments.
                Tools used to support this development program included test rigs, simulator and prototype vehicles this
                ensured component functionality and compliance evolved to specification throughout the development
                gateways.
                This was a challenging role which allowed me to improve not only engineering skills but also many
                transferable skills including cross-functional communication, presentation to management, technical
                analysis, authoring project documentation, strong project management and time management.
